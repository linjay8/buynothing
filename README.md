## Buy Nothing Project

This is an place where you can offer up any goods or services you have an excess of (for free)! Your local community benefits from the gift economy, the world benefits from less waste, and you can get rid of some things you've needed to get rid of for some time. You can also create ask posts for anything, big or small, and maybe someone in your community can help! This is an imagined extension of a pre-existing organization/project (buynothingproject.org). I am not affiliated nor am I claiming this as my original concept.
